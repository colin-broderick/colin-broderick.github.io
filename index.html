            <h3>Quantum computation dissertation</h3>
            <h4>2024-02-24</h4>
            <p>Originally written in 2017, or maybe 2016, as the final dissertation for a Master's degree in
                mathematical physics (<a
                    href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/taught/gravity-particles-and-fields-msc">Gravity,
                    Particles and Fields</a> at the Univerity of Nottingham). Rewritten in HTML around 2020 as an excuse
                to tinker with some basic CSS and JavaScript. Quantum circuit diagrams were drawn with a tool I wrote to
                generate SVG diagrams from simple text input. Section numbering, and cross-referencing of figures and
                such, is automatically filled in by JavaScript.</p>

            <h3>Quaternions</h3>
            <h3>2024-02-25</h3>
            <p>This article was originally published on Medium in 2021. At the time I was trying to properly understand
                quaternions for 3D rotation while working on an inertial localization system. This was written mainly to
                convince myself that I was understanding them properly. As a nice side benefit, I also made about 76
                pence from Medium#s partner programme!</p>
            <p>I had originally planned a series of several articles, but as with many of these projects, I ran out of
                time and had to move onto other concerns. But it worked. Writing this revealed several misconceptions
                and led to the discovery of more than one bug in my localization code. The rubber duck effect is no
                joke.</p>

        <p>I'm a big believer in the saying "Good design is as little design as possible", especially when applied to
            visual layout and graphics, and I take that philosophy to its logical extreme. My web content looks like
            this on purpose. Focus on the content, not the dressing.</p>
