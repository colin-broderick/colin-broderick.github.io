        <h3>Quantum computation dissertation</h3>
        <h4>2024-02-24</h4>
        <p>Originally written in 2017, or maybe 2016, as the final dissertation for a Master's degree in mathematical
            physics (<a
                href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/taught/gravity-particles-and-fields-msc">Gravity,
                Particles and Fields</a> at the Univerity of Nottingham). Rewritten in HTML around 2020 as an excuse to
            tinker with some
            basic CSS and JavaScript. Quantum circuit diagrams were drawn with a tool I wrote to generate SVG diagrams
            from simple text input. Section numbering, and cross-referencing of figures and such, is automatically
            filled in by JavaScript.</p>
